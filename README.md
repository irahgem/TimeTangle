# TimeTangle
Timetangle is a scheduling visualization app that helps users understand patterns in customer scheduling behavior. It fetches data from an external API and uses React and Chart.js to display the data in a user-friendly manner. The app has two main components: a DateGraph and a TimeGraph. The DateGraph shows the number of appointments for each day in the selected month, while the TimeGraph shows the number of appointments scheduled for each time slot during a selected day.

With Timetangle, users can quickly and easily identify trends in customer scheduling behavior, such as peak appointment times and popular dates for scheduling appointments. Armed with this information, users can make informed decisions about staffing, scheduling, and other aspects of their business operations.

Overall, Timetangle is a powerful tool for any business looking to better understand and optimize their scheduling processes.
